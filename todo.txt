buggy:
	shouldn't drop mic samples, should spill over into next buffer
	split up input and output text streams
	why is sfml window laggy
	remove deallocations from callback?
		ops contain vectors, vectors delete memory at the end of their lifecycle

rearchitecture:
	binding
	scripting

features:
	live qwerty keyboard input
	game controller input
	performance log = entire mic input + timed commands
	pitch shift
	create instrument out of recorded audio
