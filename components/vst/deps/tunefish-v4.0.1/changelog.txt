- v4.0.1  -  May 5th, 2014
-----------------------------------------------------

- When using no ADSR, instruments were cut immediatelly resulting in plopping. This is fixed.
- ADSR zero decay will no longer cause volume go up and cause things like reverb crashes or host going to mute.
- Saving an instrument caused the preset file to grow larger and larger due to appending instead of rewriting the contents.
- Restore instrument button did not work
- Instrument count is now 1000
- ADSR1 will not cut the note if ADSR2 is still going. 
- Fixed Reverb width.
